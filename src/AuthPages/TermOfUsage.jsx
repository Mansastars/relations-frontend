                        With respect to entrepreneurs within the meaning of § 14 BGB (German Civil Code), these
                        terms of usage and the contracts regulated therein shall be governed exclusively by the
                        laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, to the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts
                        for the International Sale of Goods.

                        If the user is a merchant within the meaning of commercial law, a legal entity
                        under public law or a special fund under public law, then the registered office
                        of the provider is the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all legal disputes
                        arising from or in connection with the terms of usage. Otherwise, the statutory
                        places of jurisdiction shall apply.

                        The provider reserves the right to unilaterally amend these terms of usage if this
                        appears objectively justified. Changes are objectively justified, for example, in
                        the event of an expansion or change in the functions of the application, a change
                        in the legal or statutory situation (for example, if case law declares a section
                        invalid) or if the equivalence relationship existing at the time of conclusion of
                        the contract is disturbed to a not insignificant extent due to unforeseeable
                        changes that are not caused by the provider and over which the provider also has no
                        influence. The prerequisite for a change is always that it is reasonable for the user.

                        the provider and the provider has pointed out the legal consequences of failure
                        to object.
